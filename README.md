# CS50

This are the solutions to CS50 Havard taught by David J. Malan which I throughly enjoyed and highly recommend. Link to course: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/weeks/0/

You may have read on reviews that this course might be too difficult for a complete beginner but I assure you that it is not. As a beginner myself before starting the course, I found that this course is well paced and sufficient guidance is provided by the walkthorugh which comes with each problem set.

You will definitely have to google for some functions and code to achieve what is set out in the problem set and I feel that this is a good thing. It taught me to read through documentation and draw the links between the function and the use I have for it.

In addition, David is an excellent lecturer who brings a lot of energy into each and every lecture. So the lectures will never lull you to sleep.

I uploaded the source code to this repository with the sole purpose of keeping track of the courses I have completed and the code I have written so that I may refer to them again if need be.

Feel free to use this as a reference if you need help in solving the problem sets.
